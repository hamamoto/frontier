				<p>
					The landscape of design is changing quickly and it’s time to rethink design education, together. As the field embraces an increasingly amorphous definition of practice and an ever-expanding toolset, educators have a unique opportunity to imagine the many possible futures of graphic design, and to speculate, dream, and ideate on the role of future graphic designers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Frontier is a conference concerned with alternative models for learning, radical pedagogy, utopianism, emerging technology and tools, global economics and design, virtual classrooms, invisible worlds, the growing relationship between design and tech, homogeneity in design, imagined scenarios, the role of critique in a post-internet culture, and the speculative future of graphic design education.

						Many believe creativity is something you’re born with, rather than a skill you can learn. But, being a professor of graphic design, I believe teachers can and should stimulate creative thinking, regardless of the subject matter. Every child is naturally imaginative, but as they grow up they’re taught to conform. One way to encourage students to uncover their originality is to build an environment that is free of judgment. To be creative is to be abnormal, in that it requires thinking in unique ways. In order to be comfortable with artistic expression, students also must feel free to make “mistakes”—they should even be encouraged to do so. If students are comfortable failing, sharing, and making—they will be able to explore with breadth and depth. Design educators can encourage such experimentation via introducing a variety of methodologies and play. What I propose for my session at the AIGA Design Educators Conference is a workshop-style session where groups play a series of games (that could be later brought into their classrooms). Afterward, the groups would have discussions on disruptive thinking as it relates to the design curricula/classroom.

More opportunities to create bigger impact.  How might we think wrong about design education to empower students and faculty to revolutionize our profession and confront the challenges of the future?

						Study after study have proven the link between physical activity and increased creativity, so why are we not encouraging exercise in our design curriculum? Participants of this workshop will explore their design processes together while (leisurely) hiking before completing a design activity.
